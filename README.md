# CSCE4753-Server-Client-Project
Final programming project for the hardware course, Computer Networking at the University of Arkansas. The user opens up the two Python files on separate Terminal sessions in order to work. The client side sends requests to update some data. The server side takes that request and handles the updating of values and sends back confirmation of the updates.

Step 1: Open two different windows of Terminal.

Step 2: Put the server.py file into one of these windows and run it.
	- You can run the server.py file by entering 'python3 server.py' at the command line.

Step 3: Put the client.py file into the other window and run it.
	- You can run the client.py file by entering 'python3 client.py' at the command line.

Step 4: The user should now be able to do the following activities from the client window:
	* Deposit money into the account on the server.
	* Withdraw money from the account on the server.
	* Check the balance of the amount in the account on the server.
