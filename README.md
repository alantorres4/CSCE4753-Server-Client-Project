# CSCE4753-Server-Client-Project
Final programming project for the hardware course, Computer Networking at the University of Arkansas. The user opens up the two Python files on separate Terminal sessions in order to work. The client side sends requests to update some data. The server side takes that request and handles the updating of values and sends back confirmation of the updates.
